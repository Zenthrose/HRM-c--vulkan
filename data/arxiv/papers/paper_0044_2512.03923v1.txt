Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Reservoir Seepage Equations

Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.
